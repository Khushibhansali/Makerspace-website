            <h2>Importance on a Graduate Campus</h2>
            <p>
              In a graduate campus like Cornell Tech, our makerspace plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. It provides a platform for students to experiment, prototype, and turn their ideas into reality, which is essential for their academic and professional growth.
